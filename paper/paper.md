## Statement of need

Every year, the United States experiences hundreds or thousands of
foodborne outbreaks [@dewey2016foodborne].
However, a large percentage of bacterial foodborne outbreaks are
caused unknown etiology [@10.1093/cid/ciab771].
However, with the advent of real time genome sequencing surveillance,
genomes for foodborne outbreaks are readily available [@jackson2016implementation].
It has been shown that using a random forest (RF) model
can help lend some predictability to finding food sources [@gu2023predicting].
Therefore we have created a RF package in the R language
to help predict food sources from pathogenic bacterial genomes.
